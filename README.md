# Dashboard
This will display daily activities that need to be done, notifications and anything the system wishes to bring to the user’s attention.
# P.O.S
This will facilitate the sale of the products. It will allow the searching of products and including them in the orders list. Once the order is confirmed the user will be redirected to the receipt printing section.
# Items
The items section will list all the available products in the catalogue. There will be additional features like grouping sorting and filtering to help manage the inventory in the right manner.
# Customers
Based on the last review, this section was not highly needed for the retail section, rather it was intended for the wholesale section. Thus it will be included in the wholesale and the vehicle sales section but will not be included for the retail section. Its purpose is to manage and maintain repeat customers which intern can help better the relation with the customers.
# Sales
This section will keep track of all sales. A general listing will be available while providing advanced sorting and filtering options to help get a report on how the business is fairing.
# Transactions
This section will help manage the transactions that occur in the business. Thus, allowing for easy back tracking for all sales and transactions.
# Vendors
This section is intended to manage the suppliers and receiving of all products. This will ensure that the receiving process is carried out in the right way and every item is accounted for.
# User Accounts
This area will be used to manage the employee accounts and their privileges. The Admin account reserves the right to create the users and give them privileges in accordance. The rest of the accounts will be locked for only viewing. The only updates allowed are password updates and resets.
# Reports
This section will display all the reports as decided. This section is subject to changes as deemed necessary. This means that as the system grows the user can request for more customized reports to ensure better inferencing.
